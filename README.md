# Dindi
A personal finance manager for finance-flows-obsessed

-----

Building a personal finance manager has been on my TODO list for something like 10 years,
I've started tracking all my expenses in 2006 because I liked the stats and answers I can derive
 from that and I was looking for the best app to help me since that.
I've used Excel, [Money Manager EX](http://www.moneymanagerex.org/) and finally 
[Mini$](https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/25726/collapsible-company-menu).

Dindi was build to fulfill some of these missing features:

* Allow to quickly track expenses via mobile
* Keep the data online, safe and accessible on multiple platforms
* Allow sharing accounts, give read/write access to a family member
* Track vehicle usage, for real stat-obsessed to get the exact consumption of your car
* Get friendly reminders about upcoming bills
* Provide a quick search and report tools

At the end this is also a playground, I've started multiple time to implement it,
in Python/Django, Meteor and now in pure JS/React: because learning while doing is twice as fun.
